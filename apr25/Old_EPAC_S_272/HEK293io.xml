<!--
     Each file will have a set of concentrations in compartments
     sampled according to a specific dt
-->

<!--
    Every Output block must have in its definition one (and only)
    instance of:
     * filename
    And might have one (and only) instance of:
     * region or
     * dt
    If "region" is ommited then the concs for the whole system will be
    saved.
    If "dt" is ommited than the concs will be written at each time step.
    So th "io file" will be dependent on information stated in the
    "morph" (regions) and "model" (dt).
