    <introduction>
	Items f type GUIState holds the current state of the user interface. 
	They have elements (numbers, true/false values, text etc)
	for each component that appears in the user interface.
    </introduction>

    <body>
	GUIState items are one of the three ways in which data is stored in the 
	application. The other two are tables and assemblies. The difference 
	with tables
	comes from what is definitive: if you define the user interface first then 
	the system automatically creates the corresponiding GUIState object ot hold 
	its state; if you define the data model, then the sytem creates the user 
	interface for it. (Note, you can't define both yourself).
