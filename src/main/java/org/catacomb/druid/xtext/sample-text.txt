This is a report on a sales visit to the White research 
institute, Cambridge, March 05. I met up with Stephen 
White, the director, who then introduced me to the TAIRDB 
development team, and I gave them a tailored version of 
the std presentation. 


He suggested a number of features
which would be necessary for them to purchase - restricted 
access to the source code, support of the Alcatron A1000 
sequencer ".seq" file format (he'll email me some sample 
files), examples of microarray applications (using the 
MAGE XML format). He also suggested I contact Jim 
McCormick, tech director of the Brown institute, Texas, 
another big microarray centre which is about to get a big 
($10M) NSF grant in July to expand their informatics 
group. 


I also found out that Jim used to be in same 
Harvard lab as Prof Shona Williams, one of our customers 
in Glasgow Uni.
