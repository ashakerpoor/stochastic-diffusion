The main files are model1.xml and model2.xml

Both use stim1.xml which specifies an injection into a subset of the spines.

Separate initial conditions are applied to the spine necks. All spines based 
in SpineType spineA have their necks in the "neck" region, but the labelled
points coming from pointA in that SpineType can be addressed independently
for different spines.
