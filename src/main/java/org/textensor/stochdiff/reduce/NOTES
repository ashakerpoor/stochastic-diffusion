This package is for a utility that maps a saved state to a new initial conditions file.

The task is to find values for the concentrations in a template initial conditions file that most closely
reproduce a particular saved state under certain constraints.


Process:

1) read the target state - concentrations for nspec species in each of nel elements.

2) read the ic template 
     for each value in it vary the value and compute resulting concenctrations (nel * nspec) to get 
     the derivative of concs with respect to ic values.
     
3) these derivatives provide a matrix for taking ic values to end concentrations
      generalized inverse gives us hte ic values
      
      
Applying constraints:  - todo
