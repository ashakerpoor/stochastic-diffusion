These are various ways of turning a morphology into a set of elements of constrained volume. 
The output is a set of boxes each with a volume and coupling constats to its neighbors.

The SegmentSlicer cuts segments along their axis but doesn't slicek them up 
longitudionally (that is, it 'segments' as in segments of a dendrite, not segments of 
an orange)

The DiscBoxer chops a short segment into boxes longitudinally 
(cutting a cake into cubes of side equal to the height of the cake).

The TreeBoxDiscretizer discretizes a tree structure into boxes. It first chops it into discs and then 
chops these into boxes.  It does fairly sensible things with carrotoid segments as long as the two 
ends are not too different in radius.
